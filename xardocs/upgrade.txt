- Replace all files in your sitecontact module directory with the new release files.
- Go to your Modules administration listing and click on Upgrade and then Activate the module.


Upgrading from a version less than 1.1.0
===============================
If you are upgrading from a version less than 1.1.0 please read the detailed instructions
in the 1.1.0 release page at http://xarigami.com/resources/sitecontact_1.1.0, or pay
special attention to the following in the 1.1.0 upgrade:

There were template changes and therefore you should update any custom templates you may have
with the changes listed below. Use a good diff tool with your override templates against the following:
* Changes in the user-main.xd template for required fields and 'required' text
* Changes in the admin-modifyconfig.xd and admin-managesctypes.xd template with addition of a new
  fieldset for 'Field configuration'

If possible, test the upgrade and template changes on your local development
copy of your site. You can prepare any new changed override templates that you may require
in advance and update them to your live site at the time you upgrade your module.

* Changes marked Critical are required otherwise the module to fail if not completed.

* Changes marked Important are required to ensure you get the fixed or improved
functionality.

* Other changes are code efficiency or tidy changes, and may
improve display output. For best results diff your custom templates against the
corresponding new Sitecontact module template.

Upgrading to Version 1.3.3
=====

1. Please delete your old Sitecontact module, and replace with the Sitecontact
   1.3.3 module (this assumes you have any customized templates or files in your
   theme). In your site in the Administration Module Listing, upgrade and then
   activate the module.

2. If you have custom email templates:
   a. Critical change upgrading to 1.1.x from prior version
    - rename any email templates that you have customized per
      form, to use a hyphen(-) rather than an underscore(_) between the main
      template and the form name eg user-usermail-html-myform.xt rather than
      user-usermail-html_myform.xt

    b. You should use a good diff application to copy over any new changes
    in system templates to your customized templates.

3.  In your custom or form specific user-main.xt template:
    a. Critical change upgrading to 1.1.x- ensure you change contactus.php to respond.php in the
    form tag. The contactus.php function is now deprecated and respond.php is
    the function the form submits to.

    b. Important change upgrading to 1.1.x- Compare the new user-main.xd template at the point and
    your customized template.

    Note where username, useremail, company, requesttext, usermessage,
    bccrecipients and ccrecipients input tags are added. If you are using these fields,
    ensure you have the new <xar:set /> and <xar:data-input /> tags and their content.

    For the each field ensure you have the two <xar:if /> lines with the equivaent :
        <xar:if condition="in_array('username',$fieldconfig)">
         ....
        </xar:if>

    and also:
         <xar:if condition="isset($invalid['username']) and !empty($invalid['username'])">
         ...
         </xar:if>

    c. Critical change for 1.1.0 - Ensure you have all the template code in the new
    user-main.xd template between the comments "Dynamic Data properties input"
    and "Dynamic Data properties input -end" added to your template to replace
    existing DD property input.

    d. Important change for 1.1.0- Ensure you have all the template code in the new
    user-main.xd template between the comments "Start captcha support "
    and "End captcha support" added to your template to replace any existing
    formcaptcha template code.

4.  Critical change for 1.1.0 - A new user-result.xd template exists that is displayed to the user on
    successful fom submission. You can override this to form a custom page as
    is, or for a specific form by appending the form name in the usual way
    see the module Overview).
