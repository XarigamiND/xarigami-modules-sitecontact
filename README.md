# XarigamiND SiteContact Module

SiteContact is a simple to use module that enables a site administrator 
to quickly and easily setup one or more forms with different fields 
and configurations using dynamic data. The responses can be emailed back
to nominated Administrator(s). The module comes preinstalled with one
default Contact Form and can be custom templated per form.

Forms can be used with CAPTCHA for anonymous users, and form
responses can also be saved in your database for review by administrators.
